# Parisian-ChatBot_DataCamp-Projects

DataCamp provides a multitude of projects for learners to tackle. In this repository, I have tackled the project [Planning a Trip to Paris with the OpenAI API](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1849). The project asks to utilize the OpenAI platform to develop a chatbot to answer three pre-defined questions about exploring Paris and offer customized recommendations.

In my solution, I have created a function that receives users' inputs on the desired model and the questions they have and provides up-to-date recommendations. The question set can be further updated to include any questions desirable for the chatbot.
